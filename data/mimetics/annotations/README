* mimetics_v1.0.csv is a csv file that contains the URLs and timestamps of the YouTube clips, following the Kinetics format. You can thus use similar script such as https://github.com/activitynet/ActivityNet/tree/master/Crawler/Kinetics to download and trim the videos.
* mimetics_v1.0_objectsceneannot.txt contains annotation per video (one video per line) about the presence of a relevant object, of a relevant scene, as well as a binary label whether the actor is a mime artist. The object is a binary label that indicates whether a relevant object is present or not, and similarly for the scene label.
* mimetics_v1.0_clsannot.txt contains annotation about the size of the manipulated objects as well as the relevance of a particular scene for each class. Object sizes are either "no", "small", "medium" or "large". In the paper, we report either for no/small object and medium/large. Scene label is either "yes" or "no".
